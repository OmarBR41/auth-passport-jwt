## Setting up

To set this project running locally, you can clone the repository. Open a terminal in both folders and install the dependencies for each package.json. After the installation, run the development script for each one simultaneously. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

Don't forget to have a MongoDB server running, otherwise you'll get errors from the server.
